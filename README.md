# DATA ENGINEERING PORTFOLIO

##  About Me
Senior Data Engineer specializing in building petabyte-scale data platforms, real-time streaming systems, and cloud-native data infrastructure with expertise across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

##  Architecture Philosophy
- **Infrastructure as Code First** - Everything versioned and automated
- **Scalability by Design** - Handle 10x growth without redesign
- **Observability Built-in** - Monitor everything, alert on what matters
- **Cost Optimization** - Performance without unnecessary spend
- **Security & Compliance** - Data protection as default
