# Data Platform Engineering

## About

Data Engineer focused on building scalable data platforms, reliable data pipelines, and cloud-native analytics infrastructure. Experience working with distributed systems, modern lakehouse architectures, and production data workflows across AWS ecosystems.

---

## Engineering Philosophy

- **Infrastructure as Code First** — reproducible, versioned environments  
- **Scalability by Design** — systems built to grow without re-architecture  
- **Observability Built-in** — pipelines should be measurable and debuggable  
- **Cost-Aware Engineering** — performance balanced with resource efficiency  
- **Security by Default** — encryption, IAM, and governance integrated early
